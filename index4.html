            <h1>Ooo, spooky unga bunga story come!<br><br>

                Long, long ago, when big moon high in sky, tribe sit by fire. Night dark, wind cold, brrr, but fire warm, tribe safe. Chief Gruk, biggest, bravest, he say, “Tonight, Gruk tell story of Shadow Beast.” Tribe gasp—Shadow Beast! Beast so sneaky, no one see, only hear... whispers in dark.
                <br>Gruk say, “Long ago, Shadow Beast live in cave. Hungry, always hungry, come out when moon full. First, take small things: bones, stones, food. But one night, Beast take... Gor, the Brave!” Tribe shiver, look around—no one see Gor since.
                <br>Gruk say, “Beast crawl, crawl close in dark. You think safe? Hah! No one safe. Beast have teeth sharp, eyes red, smell fear.” Tribe huddle close, fire crackle. “Only way to stop Beast? Never look at shadow... never turn around!”
                <br>Suddenly, tribe hear rustle in bushes. Snap! Everyone jump. Gruk say, “Stay close to fire! Don’t look at shadows!” But brave young Oga stand up, say, “Oga not scared!” He walk to dark... then silence.
                <br>Next morning, Oga... gone. Only shadow left where he stand. From that day, tribe stay by fire, never go out in dark. Shadow Beast still there, waiting. Hungry.
                <br><br>
                End of spooky unga bunga tale! Remember, never look at shadows...
